OpenTracerUnit is a set of arduino code and 3D designs for an assortment of airsoft guns. 

The project was started during lockdown partly due to boredom and partly because I wanted to learn some arduino code. I had just bought a Golden Eagle M870 and wanted to use tracer BB's at my local field's night games. Because it is a gas gun there is now option to link to an electronic trigger so the unit had to be self contained.

### Aims

* Be able to light up green tracer BBs
* To not interfere with the iron sights
* To be as cheap as possible

### Gun Compatibility

* Golden Eagle M8871

### Battery Compatibility

* 11.1 Li-Po (because I plan to just stuff it in the end of the magazine tube)

### Future Improvements

* Better power delivery with ability to build in USB charging (USB-C ideally)
* Smaller battery, with ability to integrate it with design (1S Li-Po). This will likely involve switching to a 3.3V logic
* More guns added to CAD design library

### In Progress

* Slim down code to run as fast as possible

### Completed Improvements
* Break code out into functions to simplify and make it easier to add features to
* Auto recalibrate if LED stays on for over X pulses

### Skills/Equipment Required
* Soldering Iron
* Snips
* Ability to flash arduino code
* Hot Glue Gun
* 3D Printer/Somewhere to get it printed
